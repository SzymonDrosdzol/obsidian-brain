The Oversecured company be bragging about finding a bunch of vulnerabilities in Xiaomi APKs with their scanner: https://blog.oversecured.com/20-Security-Issues-Found-in-Xiaomi-Devices/

The problem? They seem to no have normal pricing and want you to book meetings and shit. Makes me also thing it's gonan be expensive. But It migh be very useful for research and finding issues like [[root.research.android.oneplus.auto-open-google-play]] (exeept it wasn't actually an issue), well raz się przegrywa, raz się przegrywa.
