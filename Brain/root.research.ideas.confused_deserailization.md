# Description
Marco #Slaviero describes an interesting polyglot in PagedOut! #6: Confused Deserailization. The idea is, he created a MessagePack/Pickle polyglot file. Which is interesting, because MessagePack is deemed safe to deserialize untrusted input, as opposed to Pickle.

The idea would be to search for other, similar polyglot files. It would need to start with finding interesting format pairs, esfpecially ones safe/unsafe for deserialization. And then trying to find polyglots
# Research flaws
- Not many chances of success
- Time consuming
- Hard to convert into immediate bugs, especially at scale
# Research strengths
- If successful might be even worth a presentation
- And generally cool if successful
- Interesting and in depth
- Makes you deeply learn the analyzed formats and technologies
