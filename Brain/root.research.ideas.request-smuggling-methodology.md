- [ ] #Research Make a request smuggling methodology document
## Description
An idea would be to create a research similar to [[root.research.oauth-flows-and-flaws]], but about [[root.hacking.smuggling]].

First and foremost of course compile existing knowledge, bugs, exploitation and bounties. Main "new" creation would be creating a flow to:
- Quickly eliminate non-vulnerable targets
- Create a test-decision tree to get all possibilities into account. Something linke [[root.hacking.smuggling#Detection]] but with HTTP2 in account
