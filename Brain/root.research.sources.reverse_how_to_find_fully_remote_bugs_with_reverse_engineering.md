This video features Natalie Silvanovich from Google's Project Zero discussing her process for finding remote bugs through reverse engineering, specifically in Google Messages. She covers determining attack surfaces by using the app, analyzing APKs, reviewing logs, and reading specifications [[03:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOr1F-Tx1Zg&t=194)]. While initial focus on classifiers yielded no bugs [[11:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOr1F-Tx1Zg&t=661)], she found success in "common vulnerability areas" like media handling [[30:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOr1F-Tx1Zg&t=1805)], discovering a zero-click attack surface in Google Messages' transcription feature and exploitable bugs in OEM codecs [[32:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOr1F-Tx1Zg&t=1952)]. She concludes by emphasizing that traditional vulnerability areas remain significant despite new attack surfaces [[39:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOr1F-Tx1Zg&t=2391)].
