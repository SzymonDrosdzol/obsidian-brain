The email thread with Michael Altfield. He contacted us after publication of [[root.research.oauth-flows-and-flaws]] The idea is that some PHP systems mishandle OAuth by storing clients' tokens.
## Expected effect
Might be a vulnerability report from that (less probable). More probably maybe a blogpost/article criticising the practice.
## TODO
- [ ] Try to create a simple site according to his email and see if stripe can be paired. Observe how it's working.
